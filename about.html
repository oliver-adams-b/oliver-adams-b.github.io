<p>
    <b> Introduction:</b>
    <p>
        I was born and currently reside in Portland, Maine. I am currently in pursuit of a Masters Degree 
        in Computer Science through Northeastern's Roux Insitute in Portland, and I began in fall 2021. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I received an undergraduate degree from the University of Maine in 2019, a Bachelors of Arts in Physics with a double major in Mathematics. 
        I was  an undergraduate fellowship from the National Science foundation to complete my senior project in Physics. The grant dealt with modeling particle 
        separation in a fixed volume filled with fluid using acoustic waves. Loosely speaking, I modeled how micro-scale particles which are suspended in a droplet of water become
        separated when the dropelet is excited by surface acoustic waves. My senior project for my mathematics degree dealt with researching and ultimately writing a paper on graph-driven constructions of 
        iterated function systems. You can find more details on this located in this  <a href="http://localhost:4000/2022/04/03/IFS.html"><b>blog post</b></a> and others on this webpage.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        My formal education lays in mathematics and physics; on top of studying math and physics at the University of Maine, 
        I attended the <a href="https://www.mssm.org/"><b> Maine School of Science and Mathematics</b></a> prior to my undergraduate degree, 
        and I also participated in a study abroad semester in mathematics at the <a href="https://www.aubg.edu/"><b>American University of Bulgaria in Blagoevgrad</b></a>. At AUBG, I took courses on advanced abstract algebra, advanced linear algebra, and dynamical systems.
    <p>
        In 2019 I was recruited to be the CTO of revolv.io, now called <a href="https://muuse.io/"> <b>Muuse</b></a>. Muuse offers a technological 
        framework which aids with the circular 
        reuse of cups, and introduces a new methodology which circumvents the need for single-use waste. During my time at revolv,
         I lead a team of programmers to create the beta version of the platform. The beta version was sufficient for us to win the OpenIDEO  
        <a href="https://www.openideo.com/content/nextgen-challenge-top-ideas"> <b>NextGen Cup Challenge</b></a>. I was forced to leave revolv because of a serious health complication that required my full attention, but I continue to stay involved with the people I worked with. 
    </p>

    <p>
        After leaving revolv, I worked as recruited to be the lead data scientist at <a href="https://www.sylebra.com/"> <b>Sylebra Capital</b></a> in Hong Kong. I worked directly under the lead investor at the firm, and conducted fundamental market reasearch under his direction. Primarily, my task was to construct metrics which thinned the investible universe for the team of financial analysts. More information on one of the projects I lead can be found in my blog post <a href="http://localhost:4000/2022/04/03/NLP.html"> <b> here</b></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Covid-19 pandemic forced me to flee my position at Sylebra, and I came home to Maine in early 2020. For six months in late 2020 I contributed to the Earth Species open source project. The Earth Species Project's mission is to decode non-human language, primarily centered on Whale noise translation. You can find their website <a href="https://www.earthspecies.org/"><b>here</b></a>. I worked on decoding a curated data set of Egyptian fruit bat squeaks, created by <a href="http://www.yossiyovel.com/index.php/publications"><b>Yossi Yovel</b></a> and his team. 
        My work extended and improved the results published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017143"><b> this</b></a> paper published by Yovel in Nature. I added a custom preprocessing step to a novel model architecture which greatly outperformed the benchmarks set by Yovel. You can find some of my results posted on the ESP github page <a href= "https://github.com/earthspecies/library"> <b> here</b></a>, and you can find all of the code I wrote including what I did not publish to the community <a href="https://github.com/oliver-adams-b/library/tree/main/egyptian_fruit_bat"><b> here</b></a>
