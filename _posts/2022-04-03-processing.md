# Overview

For years I have been passionate about creating interactive mathematical art. An interactive repository of my work can be found [here](https://openprocessing.org/user/66644?view=sketches). All of the code hosted at that cite is interactive and freely modifiable. You can access the repository of all of my processing work on github [here](https://github.com/oliver-adams-b/processing_math_sketch_collection)
