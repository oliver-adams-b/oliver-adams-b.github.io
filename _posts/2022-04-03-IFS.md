# Overview

I wrote a paper on graph-directed constructions for iterated function systems, you can find a link [here](https://github.com/oliver-adams-b/IFS_matrix_base8_3D/blob/master/Oliver_Adams_Paper_on_IFS.pdf). With this paper I wrote many interactive scripts in Processing which allow one to visually explore the construction of fractals from graphs. The math behind these structures can be complicated, but interacting with these structures gives the viewer something to grasp onto. You can find an interactive 3D version of the code [here](https://github.com/oliver-adams-b/IFS_matrix_base8_3D). A GUI-based script can be found [here](https://github.com/oliver-adams-b/IFS_matrix_base4_GUI).  

# Gallery

Below is a screen capture from the base-8 code, which generates three dimensional fractals from 8x8 adjacency matrix:

Below is a screen capture of the GUI for constructing base-4 fractals. The adjacency matrix is shown at the bottom left, and the fractal is obviously shown right in the middle of the image. The graph to the right shows the box-counting dimension of the IFS, and it changes based on the adjacency matrix.

Below is a screen capture of a drag-and-drop style GUI, not using a graph-directed construction, you can actually play with this in browser [here](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/397800)
