<p>It is trivial to construct the fractal-like attractor for an iterated function system, since each IFS defines a unique fractal. However the inverse of this problem is difficult in general; given an an attractor (in this case an image), what is the iterated function system that generates that attractor? This project constructs an IFS which approximates a provided image. The non-trivial part of this project was to construct a dataset for training a model. Using graph-directed constructions of fractals, a dataset of images with uniformly distributed fractal dimension was constructed.</p>

<p>Using a graph-directed construction of iterated function systems, we can define the IFS for a large class of fractals. Essentially, we can encode the IFS for a fractal using an adjacency matrix. From an adjacency matrix, we can construct an image. The dataset consists of matrices $E$ and images which are generated by $E$.</p>
